This course includes three required assignments.

Presentation

Students make three short presentations, based on the required readings. Each presentation is a critical review of the required paper or book section and is 15-20 minutes in duration.

Animal Behavior Laboratory

Students are required to observe animal behavior in the animal's home cage, or in a behavioral arena. Students will be judged on the completeness of their lab notes, and on their ability to observe different behaviors exhibited by the animal during the testing period.

Project Paper

Each student does a 15-20 page final project paper and presentation on a topic approved by the professor.
